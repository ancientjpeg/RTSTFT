# (jk's) RTSTFT

### \*\***PLEASE NOTE**\*\*
This library is completely non-functional as of right now.

## Synopsis
-----

RTSTFT is (or will be, at least), a C library that will lie at the core of jk's as-of yet unnamed audio plug-in. At its core, it is *(i no longer have any idea)*

## Installation
-----

At current, installation requires an up-to-date copy of the FFTW3 library to be placed in a directory called fftw_src. For now, simply grab the tarball from [their site](https://www.fftw.org/download.html),
extract it to the RTSTFT directory, and rename it to fftw_src.
